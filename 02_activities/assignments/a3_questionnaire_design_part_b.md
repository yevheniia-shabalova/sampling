# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```
    The quality of the sample is expected to be high due to the use of a stratified random sampling strategy. By ensuring representation across different departments and roles within the entry- and lower-level positions, the sample should accurately reflect the diverse experiences and reasons for turnover among former employees. Potential biases such as non-response bias could still affect the representativeness if certain groups of former employees are less likely to respond. To mitigate this, efforts should be made to encourage participation and ensure confidentiality.

    ```

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

    ```
There are some several changes to the original survey to improve its quality and address potential sources of error:

1. **Question Wording:**
   - **Original:** "What was your primary reason for leaving the company?"
   - **Revised:** "What were the main reasons for leaving the company? (Select all that apply)"
   - **Reasoning:** The revised question allows for multiple responses, capturing a broader range of factors that might have contributed to turnover.

2. **Response Options:**
   - **Original:** Limited to predefined options.
   - **Revised:** Included an open-ended option "Other (please specify)" for more detailed insights.
   - **Reasoning:** This change allows respondents to provide reasons not listed, offering more comprehensive data.

3. **Scales for Satisfaction:**
   - **Original:** Used generic satisfaction scales.
   - **Revised:** Added more specific scales (e.g., Likert scales) for questions about job satisfaction and relationship with supervisors.
   - **Reasoning:** More detailed scales can provide nuanced insights into the degree of satisfaction or dissatisfaction.

4. **Anonymity Assurance:**
   - **Added:** An introduction statement ensuring the confidentiality and anonymity of responses.
   - **Reasoning:** To increase the likelihood of honest and candid responses, ensuring better data quality.

**Revised Survey:**

1. How long were you employed at the company?
   - Less than 6 months
   - 6-12 months
   - 1-2 years
   - 2-3 years
   - More than 3 years

2. What were the main reasons for leaving the company? (Select all that apply)
   - Better job opportunity elsewhere
   - Lack of career advancement
   - Dissatisfaction with management
   - Work-life balance issues
   - Compensation and benefits
   - Workplace culture
   - Other (please specify)

3. How satisfied were you with your job role and responsibilities? (Scale of 1-5, where 1 = Very dissatisfied and 5 = Very satisfied)

4. How would you describe your relationship with your immediate supervisor? (Scale of 1-5, where 1 = Very negative and 5 = Very positive)

5. Would you consider returning to the company if the identified issues were addressed?
   - Yes
   - No
   - Maybe

6. Do you have any suggestions for improving employee satisfaction and retention at the company? (Open-ended)

    ```

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
No, the purpose of the survey could not be effectively fulfilled through an observational study. An observational study can show patterns in employee behavior and workplace dynamics but cannot capture the personal reasons and specific feedback from former employees about why they left. A survey is needed for a direct feedback, it is essential for making targeted improvements to employee satisfaction and retention.

    ```
